### CASE CONCLUSION SUMMARY:
**Objective** 
- 7 Different ML models were generated with the most effective being SVC using Radial Basis Function kernel with an accuracy of 99.66%.

**Case question/answer** 
- Can we distinguish RVC-generated speeches from real speeches using machine learning? 
- Yes, for the dataset given. However, these results do not generalise for other low quality audios such as phone calls.
